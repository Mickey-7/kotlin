create kotlin project
    File-> New-> Project-> select Kotlin-> select JVM | IDEA-> specify directory of project-> Finish

directory upon creation
    .idea
    out
    src
    project_name.iml
the src is the default source folder - based on its color

right click on src folder then create kotlin class file (.kt)
    New
        Kotlin File/Class
            select File (default option)
                enter class name
kotlin file (.kt) will be created

type main then select maina
    then enter and below code will appear
        fun main(args : Array<String>) {

        }
- the entry point to a Kotlin application

type println("Hello Kotlin"); inside the main function

    right click on the Main.kt file
        then select Run MainKt or CTRL+SHIFT+F10

    //Kotlin List stores elements in a specified order and provides indexed access to them.
    //Indices start from zero – the index of the first element – and go to lastIndex which is the (list.size - 1).
    //  Key points of List:
    //      Methods in List interface supports only read-only access to the list;
    //          read/write access is supported through the MutableList interface.
    //      Kotlin distinguishes between read-only and mutable lists.
    //          Read-only lists are created with listOf() method and mutable lists with mutableListOf() method.
    //      In Kotlin, the default implementation of List is ArrayList
    //          which you can think of as a resizable array.
    //      MutableList is a List with list-specific write operations,
    //          for example, to add or remove an element at a specific position.


    fun main(args: Array<String>) {

        //The example creates a new list of words with listOf().
        // The size of the list is determined with the size attribute.
        val words = listOf("Ab","cup","dog","spectacles")
        println("the list contains ${words.size} elements")
